  ## How_to_use
  Eat-Da-Burger! is a restaurant app that lets users input the names of burgers they'd like to eat.

  Clone repo from guthub and intall node modules, npm packages express, mysql, and express-handlebars inside project folder. Open DBeaver and use along with code to allow app to function proeperly and save information to the database for storage. Run node server.js in terminal to activate project. 

  Whenever a user submits a burger's name, your app will display the burger on the left, "On the Plate",  side of the page -- waiting to be devoured.  Each burger on the plate has a hungry-face emoji button ready to devour the burger. When the user clicks it, the burger will move to the right side of the page.  On the right, "Burgers Devoured", side of the page, the user can choose to put the burger back on the plate with the plate and utensils button.  Or if the user doesn't like the burger at all, they can toss it in the trash with the trashcan button on either side of the page. 

  Your app will store every burger in a database, whether devoured or not.

  ## Benefit
  Anyone can benefit from this project. It can be used to store order information for restaurants and stores or simply as a game just for fun.
