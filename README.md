  Eat-Da-Burger! is a restaurant app that lets users input the names of burgers they'd like to eat.

  Whenever a user submits a burger's name, your app will display the burger on the left side of the page -- waiting to be devoured.

  Each burger on the plate also has an `Eat Me!!` button. When the user clicks it, the burger will move to the right side of the page.

  Your app will store every burger in a database, whether devoured or not.

  ## Benefit
  Anyone can benefit from this project. It can be used to store order information for restaurants and stores or simply as a game just for fun.
